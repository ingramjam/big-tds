Bijan is sublimely talented and just getting started. I think he deserves to be the first RB off the board in 2025 fantasy drafts.", lastYearPPR: 19.9, logoUrl: "https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/atl.png" },

Maybe he‚Äôs at greater risk of injury this year after handling such a massive workload, but it‚Äôs hard to quantify the risk. What we can judge with a greater degree of certainty is that Barkley is a phenomenal running back and has a near-perfect ecosystem, playing with a great offensive line in a run-heavy offense. Barkley might not be able to top a 2024 regular season in which he had 2,283 yards from scrimmage and 15 touchdowns, but if he stays healthy, he‚Äôs a good bet to finish as a top-five fantasy RB.", lastYearPPR: 22.2, logoUrl: "https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png" },
        { rank: 4, tier: 1, name: "Justin Jefferson", team: "MIN", position: "WR", bye: 6, notes: "A healthy Jefferson is a fantasy force of nature. He only played 10 games last season due to a hamstring injury, but he still had 68 catches for 1,074 yards and 5 touchdowns, and he was the WR2 in fantasy points per game. Jefferson is a route-running virtuoso with extraordinary ball skills. The only question is whether QB Sam Darnold will be able to consistently deliver the ball to him.", lastYearPPR: 18.7, logoUrl: "https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/min.png" },

He‚Äôs the undisputed alpha receiver in a potent Dallas passing attack, and he‚Äôs still only 26 years old. Lamb is a good bet to finish as a top-three fantasy receiver once again.", lastYearPPR: 17.6, logoUrl: "https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/dal.png" },

Gibbs is a big-play machine with 4.36 speed and dazzling open-field running ability. With another year of experience under his belt, Gibbs could be even more dangerous in 2025.", lastYearPPR: 21.4, logoUrl: "https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/det.png" },

        { rank: 9, tier: 2, name: "Puka Nacua", team: "LAR", position: "WR", bye: 8, notes: "Nacua followed up his historic rookie campaign with another stellar season, proving he's no fluke. He's a reliable target for Matthew Stafford and a PPR machine.", lastYearPPR: 18.8, logoUrl: "https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/lar.png" },
